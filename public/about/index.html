<p><img src="images/bread01.jpeg" style="width: 320px; margin: 10px;", align="left">
<strong>"Give me 5 shillings"</strong></p>

<p>The ragged dirty boy held out his hand. My heart tried to ignore him, but there he was standing in front of me. I shake my head and move on, a bundle of mixed emotions.
I didn&#39;t have any change, but that wasn&#39;t the real reason. I always knew they would only use money to go buy glue to sniff.</p>

<p>Another, this one even younger. I don&#39;t think he has ever had a pair of shoes. There are so many. This is horrible. How could I ever be fair? What on earth can I do?</p>

<p>I move on. Shaken and confused I move on. In my pensive wandering several more hands shoot out in front of me. Younger, older, aggressive, shy. Finally, as I go back to my hotel, I wonder and pray. I resolve to try to have bread, fruit, or snacks in my bag when I go out to the street. Any that cross my path will at least receive something.</p>

<p>How did this happen? How could so many children end up wandering the streets aimlessly searching for something to eat? Living with no hope, love or security. I know they find and follow me because I am gentle.</p>

<p><img src="images/bread02.jpeg" style="width: 320px; margin: 10px;", align="right">
I turn to one of them and ask, "Where do they sleep?" </p>

<p>"Under a bush, behind the shops, a few have very poor homes." </p>

<p>"What happens when they get sick?" </p>

<p>The response comes in a resigned tone, "Well..., they die." </p>

<p>That hit me hard. Such a matter of fact statement silenced me; they die. </p>

<p>My mind saw a small 8-year-old form curled tight under a pruned and ragged bougainvillea in the far corner of the park, shivering and sweating with the fever of malaria. Cold, alone, crying silently and wondering, "Where is God in this World? Does He even care about me?" Finally he closes his eyes and with one last lonely shudder finds his answer as he leaves this world.</p>

<h3>Facts</h3>

<p>Unable to comprehend the scope of the problem, unable to untangle the complex political and cultural web that created this horror, I soothed my conscience by buying loaves of bread and filling dirty hungry hands with slices. Children would multiply before my eyes. Some silent signal would call them as I opened a loaf of bread. Where there was one pleading child, now there were 10.</p>

<p>Then it hit me. What I had tried so hard to avoid. I can never go home and be the same. No matter what the reason, no matter why the children are there, no child should have to live on the street, begging for scraps of food, fighting the bites of lice and mosquitoes, hiding to avoid beatings while restlessly spending a shivering night. </p>

<p>What hope do they really have? A five-shilling piece will buy Â¼ of a loaf of white bread or a small bottle of glue. The bread fills your stomach for a moment, only dampening the screaming hunger. The glue satisfies hunger, cold, heartache and hopelessness.</p>

<p>But there are so many of them and only one of me! I can&#39;t feed the world! I can hardly feed my own. What can I do?</p>

<p>The answer was always in front of me. I am not asked to save the world, I am not asked to feed all the children. I am asked only to help with the few in front of me. The answer was already prepared before I knew.</p></div><footer><div class="container"><div class="row"><b>Second Chance Foundation, Kitale, Kenya</b><p>Second Chance is responsible for giving its children a future.</p></div><div class="row"><div class="span6"><b>Contact Us<br /></b>Email: secondchancekenya@hotmail.com<br />
